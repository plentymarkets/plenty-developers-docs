=  Client App Auth

This is an alternative authentication method for plentymarkets REST API.
It is using *OAuth 2.0* to generate a JWT token that can be used to authenticate in the REST API.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This authentication method is in *BETA* phase.
====

== Setup

To be able to use this new authentication method, you must have an active app client.

You can access *App Clients Settings* under *Setup* » *Account management* » *App clients*.

=== Create a app client

You can add a new app client by pressing the `+ New app client` button.

The `Create` page has the following options:

|===
|Option |Explanation

|*Name*
|The name of the App Client used for future reference and identification

|*Role template*

`_Use an existing role as template_`
|Select from an existing Role found in *Setup* » *Account management* » *Roles*. +

This will autocomplete the `Rights` and `Access rights` options

|*Rights*
|What REST API endpoints and actions can the client app access

|*Access rights*
|What REST API areas can the client app access
|===

An app client secret is automatically generated when creating the App client.

[WARNING]
====
After you saved, a popup appears with the *App Client secret*. +
Copy the *secret*, because you won’t have access to it afterwards. +
In case you lose your *App Client secret* you have to regenerate it.
====

After creating the App Client, you will be redirected to the *App Client detail view*.

=== App Client Details Page

Once you created an App Client, you can view the *Client ID* and *Token URL* used for generating the JWT token.

The *App Client detail view* has the following options:

|===
|Option |Explanation

|*Name*
|The name of the App Client used for future reference and identification

|*Client ID*
|Client ID used in the Token URL payload

|*Token URL*
|URL used to generate the JWT token used for REST API authentication

|*Enable app client*

`on/off`
|Enable or disable the client app overall access

|*Rights*
|What REST API endpoints and actions can the client app access

|*Access rights*
|What REST API areas can the client app access
|===

=== Regenerate App Client secrets

If you forgot the App Client secret or just want to regenerate it you can do this by clicking on *Regenerate secret*:

[WARNING]
====
After clicking the button a popup appears with the *App Client secret*.
Copy the *App Client secret*, because you won’t have access to it afterwards.

== How to authenticate with your Client App

Authentication in the REST API with an Client App requires two steps:

1. Generate the JWT token from the `Token URL` in the Client App settings
2. Use the JWT token to authenticate the REST API calls

=== Generate JWT Token

Make a `POST` request to the `Token URL` as in the following example:

[source]
----
POST [TOKEN_URL]
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Payload:
{
   client_id: [CLIENT_ID],
   client_secret: [CLIENT_SECRET],
   grant_type: client_credentials,
}
----

|===
|Variable |Explanation

|TOKEN_URL
|The `TOKEN URL` from the Client App Details Page

|CLIENT_ID
|The `CLIENT ID` from the Client App Details Page

|CLIENT_SECRET
|The latest Client App `secret` that was generated
|===

Success response:
[source]
----
{
    "access_token": [JWT_TOKEN],
    "expires_in": [JWT_TOKEN_EXPIRATION],
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
----
|===
|Variable |Explanation

|JWT_TOKEN
|The JWT token that can be used to authenticate the REST API calls

|JWT_TOKEN_EXPIRATION
|The amount of seconds that it will take until the JWT will expire from the time the JWT it is generated

The default value is `3600` seconds, but it may vary.
|===

[WARNING]
====
Once a JWT token is expired, it can not be used.
====


=== Authenticating in the REST API

For authenticating the REST API with the Client App JWT token you have to sign every request sent to the REST API
endpoints using the `Bearer Token` Authorization Type by setting the `Authorization` header:

----
Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]
----

== FAQ

=== Is there a token refresh for the JWT token?
No, at this time there is no way to refresh the JWT token without requesting a new one from the `TOKEN URL`.

=== Can you invalidate a JWT token?
No, at this moment we do not provide a way to invalidate a JWT token. A token is valid for `3600` seconds (`1` hour),
after which it will no longer be usable.

In case of emergency, you can disable the Client App until the JWT token expires.

=== How can I find what Client App is authenticated in the REST API?
You can use the `rest/users/me` endpoint to get information about the user for wich the JWT token.

_**Note:** in the json data that you will receive from the `rest/users/me` endpoint, the `CLIENT ID` is found in the `username` parameter._
