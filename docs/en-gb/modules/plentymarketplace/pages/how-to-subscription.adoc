= How to offer subscriptions on plentyMarketplace

This tutorial will introduce you to subscription plugins. We will show you how you can offer the plugins you upload on plentyMarketplace on a subscription basis rather than for a fixed price. You can also offer some features of your plugin for free while charging for others, giving both you and your customers even greater flexibility.

The `marketplace.json` provides the core functionality for your subscription plugin. Using the `interval` properties, you can decide for how long customers can use your plugin at a time. As shown in the above example, you can offer subscriptions on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, and yearly basis. While you may want to provide all of these options, it is also possible to only allow monthly subscriptions for example. To do this, remove the other options from your code. Each `interval` has a `price` property associated with it. Here, you can enter how much you want to charge in Euro for the respective interval. Only values higher than 10.00 are valid.

== Service provider

.plugin-hello-subscription-world/src/Providers/HelloSubWorldServiceProvider.php
[source,php]
----
include::example$SubscriptionServiceProvider.php[]

If the subscription has been paid, the customer has access to the contents of `ServiceProviderForPremiumComponenents.php`. Be sure to replace the class names in this service provider with the ones you use in your plugin.
