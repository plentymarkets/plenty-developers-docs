Whenever a customer purchases your service, customer information is sent to the address you provide in the *Webhook URL* field. The information is sent in a `JSON` file.

If you have your own server, you can use it to receive the file by entering the payload URL in the webhook field. If not, you can use an external service, or our link:https://marketplace.plentymarkets.com/en/plugins/integration/marketplaceservice_6195[Service Helper plugin^] and receive customer data as tickets in your plentymarkets system.

If you're using the plugin solution, enter `DOMAIN/service/tickets` as webhook URL, where `DOMAIN` is the domain of your plentymarkets system.
