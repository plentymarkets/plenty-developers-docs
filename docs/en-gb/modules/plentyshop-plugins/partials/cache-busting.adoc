= Adding cache busting in Ceres

We created the new helper PHP class BuildHash.php. This class serves to create a hash, which is renewed every time the plugin set is built. That way, the cache can be reset when the plugins are assembled. The global context class in Ceres (`/src/Contexts/GlobalContexts.php`) provides the global variable `buildHash`, which can be used as a GET parameter. The "buildHash" variable can also be used as a suffix for ressource URLs for Javascript, CSS, image ressources, etc. which makes it possible that these ressources are removed from the cache when the plugins are saved and published again.
