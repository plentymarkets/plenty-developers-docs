= Using the plugin interface

The plentymarkets plugin interface is a collection of interfaces.
It represents all the modules and sub-modules available in plentymarkets.
These modules contain all methods necessary for your plugin to communicate with plentymarkets.

This page covers the following steps:

* Integrating the plugin interface into an IDE
// * Configuring top items in plentymarkets
* Modifying the TopItems plugin to display top items

== Integrating the interface into your IDE

You can integrate the interface into your IDE.
Integrating the interface allows you to use your IDE's auto-complete feature when developing plugins.
Regardless of which IDE you use, start by carrying out the following steps:

. Clone the link:https://github.com/plentymarkets/plugin-interface[plugin interface repository^].
. Switch to the branch that corresponds to your system version.

[NOTE]
.System version
====
plentymarkets systems run on one of the following versions:

* stable
* early
* beta

By default, test systems use the stable version.
To check or change your system version, proceed as follows:

. Open your plentymarkets back end.
. Go to *Setup » Client » Default client » Version*.
. Check the version of your system.

Note that the system versions stable and beta correspond to the branches stable7 and beta7 respectively in the plugin interface repository.
====

Select your IDE of choice to continue.

[tabs]
====
Visual Studio Code::
+
--
. Open Visual Studio Code.
. Open the TopItemsPlugin project.
. Go to *File » Add Folder to Workspace...*.
. Select the plentymarkets plugin interface folder.
. Click on *Add*. +
icon:arrow-right[] The plugin interface is added to the workspace.

. In the *Include path area*, click on *Add*.
. Select the plentymarkets plugin interface folder.
. Click on *OK*. +
icon:arrow-right[] The plugin interface is added as an external library.
. Click on *Apply*.
. Click on *OK*. +
icon:arrow-right[] The plugin interface is now a source.

== Configuring top items in plentymarkets

Add tags configuration when rewriting deprecated contracts.
////

== Filtering top items

It's time to modify your base plugin, so that it displays your top items in your shop.
You can set an item as top item when editing the item.
Test systems come with some pre-configured top items by default.
This means your plugin can display these items without any additional setup.
This way, you can edit your plugin and see the results straight away.

First, you need to filter your items for top items.

. Open `src/Controllers/TopItemController`.
. Add the following code snippet.

.TopItemsController.php
[source,php]
----
include::example$TopItemsController.php[]
----

<1> Extends `ItemDataLayerRepositoryContract` to access its `search` method.
<2> Defines which database columns to include in the search.
<3> Defines which values to search for.
<4> Represents the top items option at the item level.
<5> Searches for all top items.
<6> Saves the search results in an array.
<7> Renders the seach results in the TopItems template.

With this, you've filtered all the items in your system for the top items.
Next, you have to display them.

== Displaying top items

plentymarkets shops use TWIG templates to display content.
Your plugin currently contains one template, `Index.twig`.
This is the template you accessed when going to the `/hello-world` route in your shop.
To display your top items, create two additional templates.
One template provides the general design of the page, the other injects the item data.

Start by creating the necessary files:

. In the `resources/views` folder, create `PageDesign.twig`.
. In the `resources/views` folder, create a new `content` folder.
. In the `resources/views/content` folder, create `TopItems.twig`.

Open `PageDesign.twig` and add the following code snippet:

.PageDesign.twig
[source,twig]
----
include::example$PageDesign.twig[]
----

<1> Inserts a bootstrap style sheet. This matches the styles used in the default plentyShop.
<2> Provides space for injecting content from other templates.

Next, open `TopItems.twig` and add the following code snippet:

.TopItems.twig
[source,twig]
----
include::example$TopItems.twig[]
----

<1> Specifies the template to use as basis.
<2> Specifies where in the base template to inject the content.
<3> Displays any top items found or a message if there aren't any.
<4> Renders each item as a card. Each card contains the specified data, as long as the data is set on the item.

Finally, to make the top items view accessible in your shop, you have to add a new route to your `RouteServiceProvider`.

. Open `TopItemsRouteServiceProvider.php`.
. Add a new router to the `map` function.

.TopItemsRouteServiceProvider.php
[source,php]
----
    public function map(Router $router)
    {
        $router->get('hello-world', 'HelloWorld\Controllers\ContentController@getHelloWorldPage');
        $router->get('topitems', 'TopItems\Controllers\TopItemsController@showTopItems');
    }
----

== Deploying the plugin

It's time to upload your changes.
You can upload the changes with plentyDevTool.

. Open plentyDevTool.
. Toggle TopItems active. +
icon:arrow-right[] plentyDevTool displays the changed files.
. Click on *Push*. +
icon:arrow-right[] plentyDevTool uploads the TopItems plugin to your system.

Like before, you now have to deploy your changes:

. Open your plentymarkets back end.
. Go to *Plugins » Plugin overview*.
. Open the plugin set where you uploaded TopItems.
. *Save* the plugin set. +
icon:arrow-right[] The plugin set is deployed.

Once the deployment process has finished, you can check the results.
For this, open your shop in the browser.
Then, append `/topitems` to the URL.
Your browser now displays your system's top items.
If you haven't configured any top items, it displays a message instead that the plugin couldn't find any top items.
