= Plugin definition

To register and run a plugin in plentymarkets, you have to define some basic information.
This information is stored in a `plugin.json` file.
The `plugin.json` is required for all plugins.
It's located in the root directory of the plugin.

This page details the contents of the `plugin.json`.

== version

icon:warning[role=red] [red]#Required#

_Possible values:_ string

The current version of the plugin.
plentymarkets plugins use semantic versioning.
This means the version format is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

As you're making changes to your plugin, you should increase the version to reflect the nature of the changes.
Increasing the version is required when updating the plugin on plentyMarketplace.
For a guideline on when to increment which version, refer to the table below.

.Version increments
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Â Version | Explanation

| MAJOR
| The update isn't backwards compatible.

| MINOR
| The update is backwards compatible. +
The update adds new functionality.

| PATCH
| The update is backwards compatible. +
The update fixes a bug.

== require

_Possible values:_ array or object

Specifies other plugins that have to be present in the plugin set for the plugin to run properly.
This value isn't required, but provides useful information to the user.

plentymarkets plugins use semantic versioning.
This means you should specify requirements in a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
It's possible to use operators for specifying multiple versions efficiently.
The following operators are available:

* `>`
* `>=`
* `<`
* `<=`
* `!=`
* `~`

The tilde operator (`~`) describes a range in-between two versions.
It's essentially a short-hand form for combining the operators `>=` and `<`.
For example, requiring the version `~1.2.3` is the same as requiring any version between 1.2.3 and 1.3.0.
In this example, the required version has a non-zero digit in the "fix" position.
This means that the upper boundary is determined by the next highest minor version.
If the requirement is `~1.2.0`, the upper boundary is determined by the next highest major version.

== platform

_Possible values:_ array or object

Specifies on which PHP version the plugin runs properly.
This value isn't required, but provides useful information to the user.

The following operators are available:

* `>`
* `>=`
* `<`
* `<=`
* `!=`
* `~`

The tilde operator (`~`) describes a range in-between two versions.
It's essentially a short-hand form for combining the operators `>=` and `<`.
For example, requiring the version `~7.3` is the same as requiring any version between 7.3 and 8.0.
In this example, the required version has a non-zero digit in the "minor" position.
This means that the upper boundary is determined by the next highest major version.

== isClosedSource

_Default:_ `false`

_Possible values:_ `true`, `false`

Determines if the plugin source code is visible in the plentymarkets back end when installing the plugin from plentyMarketplace.
The source code is always visible when installing the plugin via Git.
It's also possible to download open source marketplace plugins with plentyDevTool and view the source code this way.
